  1. Project Overview and ObjectivesThe objective of this project was to create a robust system for managing employee records using Java. The focus was on mastering the Java Collections Framework for in-memory data management and File I/O for permanent data storage.Technical Requirements MetCollections Framework: Utilized a HashMap<Integer, Employee> to store records, ensuring $O(1)$ time complexity for searching and retrieving employees by their ID.File I/O Implementation: Developed logic to read from and write to a flat-file database (employees.txt), ensuring data is not lost when the program closes.CRUD Functionality: Implemented the ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records via a console-based interface.2. Setup and Installation InstructionsClone the Repository:git clone [YOUR-WEEK-4-REPO-URL]Open in IDE: Open the project folder in IntelliJ IDEA.Run Application: Locate src/Main.java, right-click, and select Run 'Main.main()'.Dependencies: Ensure Java JDK 11 or higher is installed. No external libraries are required.3. Code Structure & Technical ExplanationThe project follows a modular design to separate data, logic, and user interaction:ClassResponsibilityEmployeeThe Data Model representing an individual employee (ID, Name, Department, Salary).EmployeeManagerThe Service Layer containing the HashMap and all business logic for CRUD and File I/O.MainThe Presentation Layer (CLI) that handles user input and displays the menu.4. Data Format SpecificationTo ensure data persistence, the system saves employee records to a file named employees.txt.Format: Comma-Separated Values (CSV).Schema: EmployeeID,Name,Department,SalaryExample Entry: 101,John Doe,Engineering,75000.05. File Handling ProceduresThe EmployeeManager class manages the lifecycle of the data through two primary procedures:Startup (Loading): When the app starts, it checks if employees.txt exists. If so, it reads the file line-by-line, parses the CSV strings into Employee objects, and populates the HashMap.Shutdown/Save (Persisting): Every time an employee is added or deleted, the system overwrites employees.txt with the current contents of the HashMap to ensure the file is always up-to-date.6. Employee Management WorkflowsThe system operates through a standard workflow loop:Initialization: Load existing data from the file.User Input: The user selects an option from the menu (1-5).Validation: For "Add" or "Update," the system checks if the ID already exists or is valid.Execution: The EmployeeManager modifies the HashMap.Persistence: Changes are immediately synced to the employees.txt file.7.
